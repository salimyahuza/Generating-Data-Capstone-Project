# Generating-Data-Capstone-Project

## Data Generation and Visualization Project

### Overview
This project demonstrates the process of generating synthetic data and visualizing it using various Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly. The primary goal is to showcase different types of data visualizations, including histograms, time series plots, bar plots, and interactive visualizations.

### Features
This project generates synthetic data for three types of datasets: normal distribution using numpy.random.normal(), time series data with pandas.date_range() and cumulative random values, and categorical data from a predefined list of categories. The data is visualized using Matplotlib and Seaborn through static plots, including a histogram with KDE for the normal distribution, a line plot for time series data, and a bar plot for categorical data. Additionally, Plotly is used for interactive visualizations, offering interactive histograms, line plots, and bar plots for each dataset.

### Libraries Used
### NumPy:
For generating synthetic numerical data.
### Pandas:
For data manipulation and creating DataFrames.
### Matplotlib:
For static plotting and data visualization.
### Seaborn:
For enhanced data visualization with statistical plots.
### Plotly:
For interactive visualizations that can be embedded in web applications or Jupyter notebooks.

## Visualizations
### Normal Distribution:
A histogram displaying the normal distribution with a KDE curve.
### Time Series Data:
A line plot showing the trend of time series values.
### Categorical Data:
A bar plot visualizing the frequency of each category.
